# SCRIBITE INTEGRATION

It is easy to include MUImageModule in your [Scribite editors](https://github.com/zikula-modules/Scribite/).
MUImageModule contains already the a popup for selecting albums and other items.
Please note that Scribite 5.0+ is required for this.

To activate the popup for the editor of your choice (currently supported: CKEditor, TinyMCE)
you only need to add the plugin to the list of extra plugins in the editor configuration.
